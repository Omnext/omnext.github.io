**Why**
The bigger the entities, the slower your application will become when handling the data. This is because Mendix is using SELECT * queries a lot and will retrieve a lot of unnecessary data.

**How to fix**
Normalize your datamodel. Split your object into multiple objects. If the attributes really belong to each other in a one-to-one relation, just draw a one-to-one relation between the objects.
