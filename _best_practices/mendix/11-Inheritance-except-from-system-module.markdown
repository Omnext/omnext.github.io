**Why**
Inheritance, except from system module, is strongly discouraged because of the negative performance side effects.

**How to fix**
Instead of inheritance, just use separate objects which are associated to the main object. As an alternative, you can add the childâ€™s attributes to the super entity and add an ObjectType enumeration.
