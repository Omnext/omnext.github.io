**Why**
There is no need to inherit from administration.account. Administration.account may simply be extended, this is not a system module. Avoid unnecessary inheritance as this has a negative effect on performance.

**How to fix**
Just inherit from system.user instead or adapt Administration.Account so it fits your needs.
